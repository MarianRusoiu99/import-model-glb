This is a great post, but gods I hate this effect, it makes page unsearchable when very often Ctrl + F is the quickest method to find something.

That’s true - but there are ways around that. Semantically, the content is there - so just skipping the visibility setting would enable search

Thank you for this post!
Very useful, I didn't know about IntersectionObserver, more awesome features to take a look at.
